# Data Structure LIB in C

Welcome to the Data Structures Project!

This repository contains the source code for definitions and operations for various data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees), as well as code to test these operations. This code is written in C.

This project is conducted for my study, and since the code is written by me, there may be some shortcomings. I appreciate your understanding in this regard.

I hope this can be of some help to you!
